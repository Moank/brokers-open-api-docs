  title: Moank Partner API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    The Moank Partner API can be used by Moank's partners in order to provide financial products to their end customers within their own application/website.

    #Â Test objects

    Test objects can be used in the staging environment in order to test specific flow. If one of the applicant of the application has its `socialSecurityNumber` equal to one of the test object, the `applicationStatus` returned by Moank for the create application endpoint will always be the same one as described in the following table:

    Social Security Number|Application Status
    ----------------------|------------------
    199001010009 |`granted`
    199001011114 |`pending`
    199001019992 |`denied`

    # Test events

    Test events can be used in the staging environment in order to trigger background process that will update the application status. Test events are not available in the production environment and should only be used for testing. The test events are described in the following table and they can be used in the [Send Application Endpoint](#tag/Signup-endpoints/paths/~1application~1{applicationId}~1event/post):

    Test event |Description
    -----------|-----------
    `process-test-loan`|Triggers the data collection about the application. The application status will stay as `pending`.
    `grant-test-loan`|Triggers a manual review on the application. The application status will be updated to `granted`.
    `sign-test-loan`|Triggers a signature of the loan agreement. The application status will be updated to `signed`.

    # Callbacks

    Moank can send callbacks to a Partner when an application status is updated. The events that can be reported via callbacks are described in the following table:

    Event |Description
    ------|-----------
    `granted` |Triggered when the customer went through all the checks performed by Moank's underwriters.
    `signed`  |Triggered when the customer has signed his debt notice using BankID.
    `payed-out`|Triggered when Moank has paid out the money to the end customer or the Partner.
    `denied`   |Triggered when Moank denies a customer because of one of the routine checks performed by Moank's underwriters.

    The actual payload and event names sent during the callback can be customised for each partner in order to match their own specifications.
